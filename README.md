# ExoPlanetResearch
The code here is from a Udemy course by Andrei Neagoie on NodeJS. We will find habitable planets from NASA's Kepler Data!
The csv file contains the data from NASA's Kepler Research
The index file is the actual code where we filter out planets that are not habitable based on the findings from NASA
NOTE: The index file is annotated for students of NodeJS like myself. The purpose of this project is to learn about one way of using NodeJS
